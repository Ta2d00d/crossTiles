# crossTiles

This is a Linux console game I've been working on.
To try it in a Linux console, place all files in this repository in the same directory, run the makefile by simply typing make at the command line while in the directory containing the files and pressing enter, then type ./g(period slash g) and press enter to run the game.
This is a work in progress.
